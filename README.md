## Issue

This repository is supposed to minimally reproduce an issue found in the latest version of vue test utils.

## To switch between Vue 2 and Vue 3

1. For each component, switch out the lines that are commented
2. For the package.json, copy from either the package-vue2.json or package-vue3.json depending on the vue version you want to go to.
